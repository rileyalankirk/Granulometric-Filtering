Smoothing convolution filter is an averaging filter whose kernel uses the following model:\n","$$\n","\\begin{bmatrix}\n","a & d & c \\\\\n","b & 0 & b \\\\\n","c & d & a\n","\\end{bmatrix}\n","$$\n","where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers.\n","\n","3) Segments the  image  using  the clustering method. The  method is to separate the histograms of intensities in a discrete number of phases. Clustering sorts the histogram of the image within a discrete number of classes corresponding to the number of phases perceived in an image. The gray values are determined, and a barycenter is determined for each class. This process repeats until it obtains a value that represents the center of mass for each phase or class. The threshold value is the pixel value k for which the following condition is true:  ݇ $$k=\\frac{\\mu_1-\\mu_2}{2}$$ where $\\mu_1$ is the mean of all pixel values that lie between 0 and k, and $\\mu_2$ is the mean of all the pixel values that lie between k + 1 and 255.\n","\n","4) A low pass filter removes small particles. These are eliminated because they do not span enough pixels. The low pass filter removes small particles according to their widths as specified by a parameter called filter size. For a given filter size N, the lowpass filter eliminates particles whose widths are less than or equal to (N – 1) pixels. These particles disappear after (N – 1)/2 erosions.\n","\n","5) Particles that are located on the edge of the image are removed. The elimination of these particles avoids an erroneous measurement because they are not completely visible.\n","\n","6) Some particles have different phases, therefore, at the time of segmentation there are some holes on the particle.
